# this script demonstrates doing arithmetic

# Task 1: Remove the assignments of numbers to the first and second number variables. Use one or more read commands to get 3 numbers from the user.
# Task 2: Change the output to only show:
#    the sum of the 3 numbers with a label
#    the product of the 3 numbers with a label

echo "choose one number";read firstnum
echo "choose a second number";read secondnum
echo "choose a third number";read thirdnum
sum=$((firstnum + secondnum + thirdnum))
product=$((firstnum * secondnum * thirdnum))

cat <<EOF
$firstnum plus $secondnum plus $thirdnum is $sum
$firstnum multiplied by $secondnum and multiplied $thirdnum is $product
EOF
